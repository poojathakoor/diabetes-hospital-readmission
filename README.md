### Diabetes 130-US Hospitals Dataset - Prediction using Machine Learning Models

In this project, we predict hospital readmission for patients
with diabetes using Diabetes 130-US Hospital Dataset. We
explore the various aspects of this data by visualizing and
analyzing it. We performed feature engineering and PCA to
obtain data that is fit for our models to perform better. We
explore various machine learning and hyperparameter tuning
techniques to obtain better performance on our test data.
Then we do performance evaluation of various models.
